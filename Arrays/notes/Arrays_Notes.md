# ðŸ“š Arrays in Java

## ðŸ”¹ What is an Array?

An **array** is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5];         // declaration with size
int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};    // declaration with initialization
````

## ðŸ”¹ Key Properties

* Fixed size
* Index-based access (0-based indexing)
* Stores elements of the same data type

---

## ðŸ”¹ Advantages

* **Fast access** to elements using index: `arr[i]` takes O(1) time
* Simple structure
* Best for storing and iterating collections of similar data

---

## ðŸ”¹ Disadvantages

* Fixed size once declared
* Insertion/deletion at a specific index is expensive (O(n) time)
* Inefficient memory use if array is underutilized

---

## ðŸ”¹ Operations and Time Complexities

| Operation          | Time Complexity              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Access by index    | O(1)                         |
| Insertion at end   | O(1)\*                       |
| Insertion at index | O(n)                         |
| Deletion at index  | O(n)                         |
| Search (linear)    | O(n)                         |
| Search (binary)    | O(log n) â€” sorted array only |

\* amortized if array is preallocated

---

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases

* Storing lists of numbers, characters, strings, etc.
* Static lookup tables
* Matrix or grid problems
* Implementation of other data structures like stacks, heaps

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example

```java
public class ArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] marks = {90, 85, 77, 92, 88};

        // Access
        System.out.println("First mark: " + marks[0]);

        // Update
        marks[2] = 80;

        // Traverse
        for (int i = 0; i < marks.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Mark " + (i+1) + ": " + marks[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”¹ Interview Tips

* Arrays are the base for many other DSA topics like sorting, searching, dynamic programming
* Understand how to manipulate indices properly (especially in reverse and two-pointer patterns)
* Know when to use `ArrayList` (dynamic array) over raw arrays

* Sorting
* 2D Arrays
* Sliding Window, Prefix Sums
